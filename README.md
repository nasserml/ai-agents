Integrate new tools, models, and knowledge bases to tailor the agents to your specific needs and unlock new possibilities.

## üìÇ Repository Structure: A Detailed Map of the Project

This repository is organized into distinct directories, each containing valuable resources and examples:

*   **`/Financial AI analys`:**
    *   **`financial_agent.py`:**  The core script for the multi-agent system. It defines the Web Search Agent, Finance Agent, and a coordinating agent that leverages their combined expertise.
    *   **`README.md`:**  A detailed explanation of the multi-agent system, its functionality, and how to use it.
    *   **Purpose:** This directory showcases a sophisticated multi-agent system that combines web search and financial analysis capabilities. It's perfect for users who need a comprehensive overview of market trends, company performance, and relevant news.

*   **`/Foresight_Fin_AI_Agent`:**
    *   **`1_simple_groq_agent.py`:** A basic example demonstrating interaction with the Groq language model.
    *   **`2_finance_agent.py`:**  A more advanced agent equipped with YFinanceTools for accessing and analyzing financial data.
    *   **`3_agent_teams_openai.py`:** Demonstrates the power of agent teams by combining a Web Agent (using DuckDuckGo) and a Finance Agent to provide comprehensive answers to complex financial queries.
    *   **`README.md`:**  A comprehensive guide to the different financial AI agents in this directory, their features, and how they work together.
    *   **Purpose:** This directory offers a range of financial AI agents, from a simple chatbot powered by Groq to a sophisticated team of agents that leverage `yfinance` and DuckDuckGo for in-depth financial analysis. It's a great starting point for users interested in building AI-powered financial tools.

*   **`/Pdfassistant`:**
    *   **`pdf_assistant.py`:** The core script for the PDF Assistant. It sets up the knowledge base, vector database, and assistant agent.
    *   **`README.md`:**  A detailed explanation of the PDF Assistant, its functionality, and how to adapt it to different domains.

## üöÄ Getting Started: Your Journey into AI Agents Begins Here

Follow these simple steps to get started with the AI-Agents project:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nasserml/ai-agents.git
    cd ai-agents-main
    ```

    Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your repository.

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This command installs all the necessary Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

3. **Set Up Your Environment:**

    *   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project by copying the provided `.env.example`:

        ```bash
        cp .env.exmaple .env
        ```

    *   Open the `.env` file and fill in your API keys for **Groq**, **OpenAI**, and **Phi** (if applicable). These keys are essential for the agents to function correctly.

4. **Explore the Examples:**

    *   Navigate to the different agent directories (e.g., `Foresight_Fin_AI_Agent`, `Pdfassistant`).
    *   Each directory contains example scripts that demonstrate how to use the agents. For instance, to run the finance agent, you would navigate to the `Foresight_Fin_AI_Agent` directory and execute:

        ```bash
        cd Foresight_Fin_AI_Agent
        python 2_finance_agent.py
        ```

    *   Similarly, explore the other examples to understand the capabilities of each agent.

5. **Experiment in the Playground:**

    ```bash
    uvicorn playground:app --reload
    ```
    *   This command starts a local web server that hosts the interactive playground. The `--reload` flag automatically restarts the server whenever you make changes to the code, making development easier.
    *   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port specified by Uvicorn if it's different).
    *   Interact with the pre-built agents (Finance Agent and Web Search Agent) and see how they respond to your queries! Experiment with different prompts and explore their capabilities.
