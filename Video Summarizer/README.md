## üß† How It Works

1. **Video Upload & Processing**

   - The uploaded video is temporarily stored and sent to Google's Generative AI services for processing.
   - The app uses `google.generativeai` library to upload and manage video files.
   - The enhanced version uses asynchronous processing to handle large files efficiently. ‚è±Ô∏è

2. **AI Analysis**

   - An **Agent** is initialized with the **Gemini 2.0 Flash exp** model.
   - The agent is also equipped with the **DuckDuckGo** tool for supplementary web research.
   - The user's query is combined with a predefined prompt to guide the AI's response.

3. **Generating Insights**

   - The AI analyzes the video content in the context of the user's query.
   - It integrates any necessary external information via web search to provide a comprehensive answer.
   - The final response is formatted in Markdown for readability.

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling & Timeouts

- The enhanced app includes robust error handling to manage:
  - **Video Processing Timeouts**: If processing takes too long, the app will notify you.
  - **Invalid Inputs**: Warnings are displayed for missing video files or queries.
  - **Exceptions**: Any unexpected errors during analysis are caught and displayed.

## üìù Code Overview

### `app-enhanced.py` Highlights

- **Asynchronous Video Processing**

  ```python
  async def process_video_async(video_path):
      # Asynchronously handles video processing with exponential backoff
  ```

- **Caching & Performance**

  - Uses `@st.cache_resource` and `@lru_cache` for efficient resource management.

- **Customizable Prompts**

  ```python
  def get_analysis_prompt(query):
      return f"""
      Analyze the uploaded video for content and context.
      Respond to the following query using video insights and supplementary web research:
      {query.strip()}
      
      Provide a detailed, user-friendly, and actionable format.
      """
  ```

### `app.py` Highlights

- **Synchronous Video Processing**

  - Simpler processing flow suitable for smaller applications or quick setups.

- **Direct Agent Interaction**

  ```python
  response = multimodel_Agent.run(analysis_prompt, videos=[processed_video])
  ```

## üé® Customizations

- **Adjust Text Area Height**

  ```markdown
  <style>
  .stTextArea textarea {
      min-height: 100px;
  }
  </style>
  ```

- **Page Configuration**

  ```python
  st.set_page_config(
      page_title="Video Summarizer",
      page_icon="üé•",
      layout="wide"
  )
  ```

## üí° Tips for Best Results

- **Be Specific**: The more detailed your question, the better the AI can tailor its response.
- **Video Quality**: Higher quality videos with clear audio and visuals yield better analysis.
- **Patience is Key**: Processing may take time depending on the video size and complexity.
