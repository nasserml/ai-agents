            "1. The `fizz_buzz` function takes an integer `n` as input and prints the Fizz Buzz sequence up to `n`.\n",
            "2. The function uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive).\n",
            "3. Inside the loop, it checks the multiples of 3 and 5 using the modulo operator (`%`).\n",
            "4. Based on the multiples, it prints either \"Fizz\", \"Buzz\", \"FizzBuzz\", or the number itself.\n",
            "5. The example usage demonstrates how to call the `fizz_buzz` function with a specific value of `n`.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Running the Code\n",
            "\n",
            "Save this code in a file (e.g., `fizz_buzz.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python fizz_buzz.py`). The output will be the Fizz Buzz sequence up to the specified value of `n`.\n"
